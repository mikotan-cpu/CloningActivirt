                Including the popular statistics for using the service in the
                past which type of transportation is the most popular because
                each type will have different time periods. The price is the
                same, obviously different because if it is a transportation
                using vehicles such as airplanes, the fuel will be used at a
                high price, therefore the price is very expensive and the
                delivery time is much quicker. The high level therefore makes
                the use of services much less than other types, and car
                transportation is also the same, takes less transport time than
                airplanes but faster than ships, but until the delivery is
                minimal and the boat is the type that people use. Most, although
                it takes slower time to transport to all types, but with the
                cheap price and able to transport a lot of products, it is the
                most popular today.

                  According to Pogba's shocking move,<br />
                  many fans want to hear the reason from his mouth. But he came
                  out for an interview that Regarding this team move, he is very
                  obedient to his family. And his family had advised to move the
                  team when leaving 'Manchester United' a long time ago. Goodbye
                  because of the belief that the French national football player
                  Paul Pogba in 2018, he came out to interview that Pogba's
                  family advised him to leave Manchester United when he moved to
                  Juventus in 2012, because he doesn't play in the first team so
                  often. This time it was Pogba who was rumored to be moving to
                  Real Madrid, where he came out in an interview saying, 'My
                  brother is a true United fan. But he is even more angry than
                  me Because I didn't play enough He said to me that If they
                  don't want you You should go play with other teams. He is the
                  one who told me to move the team at all times. And my mother
                  said that as well However, for Pogba is a player who is often
                  faced with injury problems, therefore causing him to miss out
                  on the field often. Until he didn't show much skill And the
                  reputation gradually became quiet as well Is a reason for not
                  enough family And he thinks he should be able to enter the
                  field more

                  'Kai' fans hear the good news, it became more relieved when
                  'Sky Sport' insisted, insisting "Ken" does not move to
                  "Manchester United" and will not move anywhere in the Premier
                  League! Fans wail, don't sell Ken Sky Sports, the famous
                  British news agency. Clement has confirmed that Tottenham Hot
                  Spurs' Harry Kane did not want to sell to a good star for
                  Manchester United, which was announced tough time. The aim is
                  to defeat the rumors from the 'Daily Mail' because previously
                  claimed that Tottenham Hotspur is preparing to sell this
                  26-year-old striker if any club has the courage to pay. His
                  cost up to 200 million pounds, or about 8,200 million baht!
                  The Daily Mail has written that Levi is not happy with Ken's
                  behavior, because in the latter he created many heroic acts
                  such as being openly criticizing his own team. And announced
                  that he wanted to move the team Including an interview that
                  The Premier League season should be canceled if the match does

                  FIFA PREPARES GREEN LIGHT TO CHANGE MALE AGE RULES AT 2020

                  The occurrence of a crisis from this corona virus Allowing us
                  to see new forms of competition Like never before, quite a lot
                  like postponing or canceling an important match Modification
                  of the playing field The concept of detention of athletes, for
                  example. The latest FIFA announced the policy of the male
                  football game at the 2020 Olympic Games, starting from
                  measures to stop the spread of the virus that must detain
                  people. Resulting in the competition being postponed to next
                  year So there was a question of whether there would be a
                  problem with the athlete's age or not. Formerly, the rules of
                  a male footballer who can compete on the field Must not be
                  older than 23 years of age if postponed Some people may be
                  over the age first. The FIFA therefore states that it is
                  permissible for 24 year old players to participate in the
                  competition. Which is a reasonable and understandable matter
                  With the condition that the 24-year-old players who play
                  within the team must not exceed 3 people. However, the
                  information is not yet final May change at any time according
                  to the situation. Probably have to wait and see the definitive
                  conclusion as the race day approaches. For the female
                  footballers
